"Escape the Dragon" game similar to Google's dinosaur game. My second Pygame project and my first involving object-oriented programming in Python.

The sprites in the game are instantiated from Pygame's MySprite class. I built functions allowing the sprite to jump, double-jump, and duck. The user's score 
is kept and incremented as they dodge flames. If they hit a flame, the dragon catches up and they lose.

This is a fairly simple implementation of OOP made on a tight timeframe. In the future, I would look into adding levels to the game and sharpening up the 
graphics.
